# Cleanup System Improvements

## Problem
Previously, the cleanup system was too aggressive and would delete session folders immediately after download, preventing users from downloading files multiple times or accessing their files later.

## Issues Identified
1. **`CLEANUP_AFTER_DOWNLOAD = True`** - Deleted session after first download
2. **`DEFAULT_CLEANUP_HOURS = 1`** - Too aggressive, only 1 hour retention
3. **No user feedback** - Users didn't know when files would expire
4. **No session tracking** - No way to check session status

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved Cleanup Configuration**
```python
# Cleanup configuration
AUTO_CLEANUP_ENABLED = True  # Enable auto-cleanup for old sessions
CLEANUP_AFTER_DOWNLOAD = False  # Don't delete session folder after file download
DEFAULT_CLEANUP_HOURS = 24  # Default hours for cleanup (24 hours = user-friendly)
AUTO_CLEANUP_INTERVAL = 3600  # Auto-cleanup interval in seconds (1 hour)
```

### 2. **Enhanced Response Model**
```python
class ScrapingResponse(BaseModel):
    success: bool
    message: str
    links_count: int = 0
    images_count: int = 0
    excel_file: Optional[str] = None
    images_folder: Optional[str] = None
    session_id: Optional[str] = None
    expires_at: Optional[str] = None
```

### 3. **Session Status Endpoint**
New endpoint: `GET /api/session/{session_id}/status`

Returns:
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "status": "available",
  "created_at": "2025-07-23T10:00:00",
  "expires_at": "2025-07-24T10:00:00",
  "time_remaining_hours": 23.5,
  "files": {
    "total": 5,
    "csv_files": 1,
    "image_files": 4
  },
  "total_size_mb": 15.5,
  "download_urls": {
    "csv": "/api/download/abc123/links.csv",
    "images": "/api/images/abc123"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Frontend Improvements**
- **Session Info Display**: Shows session ID and expiration time
- **Countdown Timer**: Real-time countdown showing time remaining
- **Better User Feedback**: Clear messaging about file availability

## Benefits

### ✅ **User Experience**
- Files available for 24 hours instead of 1 hour
- Multiple downloads allowed
- Clear expiration information
- Session tracking and status

### ✅ **System Reliability**
- Less aggressive cleanup
- Better error handling
- Session status monitoring
- Graceful expiration

### ✅ **Developer Experience**
- Better debugging with session info
- Clearer error messages
- API endpoints for session management
- Comprehensive logging

## Usage Examples

### Check Session Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/session/abc123/status
```

### Download Multiple Times
```bash
# First download
curl http://localhost:8001/api/download/abc123/links.csv

# Second download (now possible!)
curl http://localhost:8001/api/download/abc123/links.csv
```

### Manual Cleanup
```bash
# Clean specific session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/maintenance/cleanup/abc123

# Clean all old sessions
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/maintenance/cleanup-all
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set custom cleanup hours
export CLEANUP_HOURS=48  # 48 hours retention

# Disable auto-cleanup
export AUTO_CLEANUP_ENABLED=false
```

### Runtime Configuration
```python
# In backend/main.py
DEFAULT_CLEANUP_HOURS = 24  # Adjust as needed
CLEANUP_AFTER_DOWNLOAD = False  # Keep for multiple downloads
```

## Migration Notes
- Existing sessions will use new 24-hour retention
- No data loss during migration
- Backward compatible with existing API
- New endpoints are optional

## Future Enhancements
1. **User Accounts**: Persistent file storage
2. **Custom Retention**: User-defined expiration times
3. **File Sharing**: Share sessions with others
4. **Storage Quotas**: Limit per-user storage
5. **Compression**: Automatic file compression
